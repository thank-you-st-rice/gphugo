A lot has changed, but not much you can see without looking at the [code](https://GitHub.com/ryanjbartley/gphugo "gphugo GitHub repository").

I've been working on making the site more responsive (and compliant with modern HTML specifications) and took some time to start making it more accessible by adding alternate text to images so assistive technology can describe the image to people who might not be able to see it.
