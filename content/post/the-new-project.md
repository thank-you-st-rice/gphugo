I know it looks like I haven't really been working on this blog, but that's just because I haven't. I haven't given up on it, but it is extremely stable at the moment and I have another project I'm working on.

I was hoping to debut it tonight, but a third party is doing something I can only wait on them to finish, so it's not ready. I don't have a sneak peak that's particularly exciting, but if you want to see it under construction, head over to the [storefront project](https://ryanjbartley.github.io/storefront "Ryanjbartley's Storefront").
