I have just completed a refactor to make development more uniform across all the platforms involved, and ensure a standard experience in all of the site editors used to build this site! If you want to take a look at the repository to see what this means, you can always head on over to the [Github Repository for this project](github.com/ryanjbartley/gphugo "gphugo github repository").

The short, version, it will be easier for me to develop. The long version, it will be easier for you to use.
