I made myself a logo, and also set the site to dark mode by default, because I like it that way. If it doesn't look that way, it's already in your history, you can click the moon in the upper right of the page to make it dark, and see it the way I use it.

I am working on automating as much personalization as possible, but most of it can be done by hand, now, if you want to run ahead of me, by forking my project on [Github](https://github.com/ryanjbartley/gphugo "gphugo Github repository")
