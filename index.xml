I made myself a logo, and also set the site to dark mode by default, because I like it that way. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look that way, it&amp;rsquo;s already in your history, you can click the moon in the upper right of the page to make it dark, and see it the way I use it.
I am working on automating as much personalization as possible, but most of it can be done by hand, now, if you want to run ahead of me, by forking my project on Github</description></item><item><title>News, if you can read it</title><link>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/news-if-you-can-read-it/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/news-if-you-can-read-it/</guid><description>Featured Photo by Ashkan Forouzani on Unsplash
I have just completed a refactor to make development more uniform across all the platforms involved, and ensure a standard experience in all of the site editors used to build this site! If you want to take a look at the repository to see what this means, you can always head on over to the Github Repository for this project.
The short, version, it will be easier for me to develop.</description></item><item><title>The New Project</title><link>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/the-new-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/the-new-project/</guid><description>I know it looks like I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been working on this blog, but that&amp;rsquo;s just because I haven&amp;rsquo;t. I haven&amp;rsquo;t given up on it, but it is extremely stable at the moment and I have another project I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
I was hoping to debut it tonight, but a third party is doing something I can only wait on them to finish, so it&amp;rsquo;s not ready. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a sneak peak that&amp;rsquo;s particularly exciting, but if you want to see it under construction, head over to the storefront project.</description></item><item><title>Labor Day</title><link>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/labor-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thank-you-st-rice.github.io/gphugo/post/labor-day/</guid><description>No real post today, because it&amp;rsquo;s a day off, but I need to test posting from my phone, so here we are.

In my last post, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m trying some new things and I am going to use this post to elaborate a bit on what those things are and why I think this is the best place to be spending my time.
First a bit about options for running a website:
They suck
There&amp;rsquo;s really no point in trying to find a website that does everything you want and is cheap and easy.</description></item><item><title>My first live post!

In reality, I prototyped the page last night and I&amp;rsquo;m basically building this site specifically to test a method for quickly building unique static sites.
